This is an experimental stereo-to-ambisonics encoder that started out as a
refactoring of the StereoEncoder plugin, which is part of the [IEM Plugin
Suite](https://plugins.iem.at/#tab-StereoEncoder). It's still very heavily under
construction. Once it's ready I'll add some documentation, pre-built binaries,
etc.

For now, it's kind of a use-at-your-own-risk type deal. Stay tuned for more.
